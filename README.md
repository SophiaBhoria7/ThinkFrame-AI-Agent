ThinkFrame is an AI-powered product strategy assistant that turns rough product ideas into detailed, structured product briefs—like a mini product strategy doc ready to drive alignment and action. Built on Claude-3-Haiku, ThinkFrame helps founders, PMs, and builders clarify, communicate, and accelerate product direction before development even begins.
